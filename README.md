# Zomato-Restaurant-Clustering-and-Sentiment-Analysis
### K Means Restaurant Clustering and Sentiment Analysis
This is a unsupervised and supervised machine learning project. This project is a part of Data Science curriculum at [AlmaBetter](https://www.almabetter.com/).
### Problem Statement
Zomato is an Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery start-up founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008. Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants, and also has food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities.
The Project focuses on Customers and Company, you have to analyze the sentiments of the reviews given by the customer in the data and make some useful conclusions in the form of Visualizations. Also, cluster the zomato restaurants into different segments. The data is visualized as it becomes easy to analyze data at instant. The Analysis also solves some of the business cases that can directly help the customers finding the Best restaurant in their locality and for the company to grow up and work on the fields they are currently lagging in.
This could help in clustering the restaurants into segments. Also the data has valuable information around cuisine and costing which can be used in cost vs. benefit analysis
Data could be used for sentiment analysis. Also the metadata of reviewers can be used for identifying the critics in the industry.

### Project Description
India is well-known for its unique multi-food cuisine, which is offered in a huge number of restaurants and hotel resorts and symbolizes unity in variety. In India, the restaurant industry is changing rapidly. More People are appealing to the concept of eating restaurant meals, whether they dine outside or have food delivered to their homes.

As a result, the purpose of this study is to analyze Zomato restaurant data in Hyderabad. Zomato is a restaurant aggregator and food delivery service based in India. With the use of unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms, the work here clusters restaurants into distinct segments and evaluates the sentiments in customer reviews. The analysis also resolves several business cases that can directly assist customers in locating the best restaurant in their area, as well as the company's growth and development in areas where it is currently underperforming.
